This Research introduces a control-inspired deep learning framework that integrates lag and lead compensation concepts into EfficientNetB3 to improve the classification of lung nodules from CT scans.
Traditional CNN models focus solely on learning spatial patterns, often overlooking the temporal or dynamic aspects of medical imaging. By applying control-theoretic compensation strategies, this model aims to enhance network stability, reduce bias, and improve classification accuracy.
